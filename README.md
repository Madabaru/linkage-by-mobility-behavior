# linkage-by-mobility-behavior
This repository contains the code for the Master thesis "Tracking Individual Behavioral Patterns". This code allows to perform linkage attacks using a histogram-based approach as well as an sequence alignment-based approach. The code is fully parallelized and built in Rust for raw speed.
